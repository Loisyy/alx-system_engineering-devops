OSI Model:What it is: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system.How many layers it has: It has seven layers.How it is organized: The OSI model is organized in a hierarchical manner, with each layer providing specific functions and services. These layers are:PhysicalData LinkNetworkTransportSessionPresentationApplicationLAN (Local Area Network):What it is: A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or building.Typical usage: LANs are used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet access among connected devices.Typical geographical size: Covers a small area, typically a single building or campus.WAN (Wide Area Network):What it is: A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, typically spanning multiple geographic locations or regions.Typical usage: WANs are used to connect LANs over long distances, often across cities, countries, or continents.Typical geographical size: Spans large distances, covering multiple cities, countries, or continents.Internet:What it is: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that use standardized communication protocols to exchange data.Typical usage: It provides access to a vast range of resources and services, including websites, email, file sharing, and communication tools.Typical geographical size: Global, covering the entire planet.IP Address:What it is: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.What are the 2 types of IP address: IPv4 and IPv6.IPv4: Uses a 32-bit address scheme, expressed as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).IPv6: Uses a 128-bit address scheme, expressed as hexadecimal characters separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).Localhost:What it is: Localhost refers to the loopback address of a device, which typically points back to itself.Usage: It is commonly used for testing and accessing services on the same device.Subnet:What it is: A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network.Why IPv6 was created: IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and to provide additional features and improvements, including a much larger address space, enhanced security, and better support for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.TCP/UDP:TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between devices. It ensures that data packets are delivered in order and without errors.UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Provides faster, connectionless communication between devices. It does not guarantee delivery or order of packets, making it more suitable for real-time applications where speed is prioritized over reliability.Port:What it is: A port is a logical endpoint of communication in an operating system. It allows multiple services or network applications to operate simultaneously on a single device.Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers:SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443Tool/Protocol to check network connectivity:Ping: Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network. It sends ICMP echo request packets to the target device and waits for a response. If the device is reachable, it replies with an ICMP echo reply packet.
