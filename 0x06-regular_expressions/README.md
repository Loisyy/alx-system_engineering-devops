Here is a comprehensive list of symbols used in regular expressions, their meanings, and code examples:

*Anchors*

- `^` - Start of line
    - Example: `^Hello` matches "Hello" at the start of a line
- `$` - End of line
    - Example: `World$` matches "World" at the end of a line
- `\b` - Word boundary
    - Example: `\bHello\b` matches "Hello" as a whole word
- `\B` - Not a word boundary
    - Example: `\BHello\B` matches "Hello" not as a whole word

*Character Classes*

- `.` - Any character (except newline)
    - Example: `A.C` matches "ABC" or "ADC"
- `\w` - Word character (alphanumeric plus underscore)
    - Example: `\w+` matches one or more word characters
- `\W` - Non-word character
    - Example: `\W+` matches one or more non-word characters
- `\d` - Digit
    - Example: `\d+` matches one or more digits
- `\D` - Non-digit
    - Example: `\D+` matches one or more non-digits
- `[...]` - Character class (match any character inside the brackets)
    - Example: `[abc]` matches "a" or "b" or "c"

*Quantifiers*

- `*` - Zero or more
    - Example: `A*` matches zero or more "A"s
- `+` - One or more
    - Example: `A+` matches one or more "A"s
- `?` - Zero or one
    - Example: `A?` matches zero or one "A"
- `{n}` - Exactly n
    - Example: `A{3}` matches exactly three "A"s
- `{n,}` - At least n
    - Example: `A{3,}` matches at least three "A"s
- `{n,m}` - At least n and at most m
    - Example: `A{3,5}` matches at least three and at most five "A"s

*Groups and Capturing*

- `(...)` - Capturing group
    - Example: `(Hello)+` captures one or more "Hello"s
- `(?:...)` - Non-capturing group
    - Example: `(?:Hello)+` matches one or more "Hello"s without capturing

*Escaping*

- `\` - Escape character
    - Example: `\.` matches a literal dot (.)

*Other*

- `|` - Alternation (OR)
    - Example: `Hello|World` matches "Hello" or "World"
- `(...)` - Subpattern
    - Example: `(Hello)(World)` matches "HelloWorld" and captures "Hello" and "World"

Note: This list is not exhaustive, but it covers most of the commonly used symbols in regular expressions.

Also, keep in mind that some symbols have different meanings depending on the context and the regular expression engine being used.
